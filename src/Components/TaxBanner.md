## Design Features

### Full-Page Overlay

- Covers the entire viewport with a semi-transparent black background (`bg-opacity-50`)
- Centered modal-style content card
- High z-index (50) to appear above all other content

### Large Image Display

- **Size**: 256x256px on mobile, 320x320px on desktop (16rem x 16rem / 20rem x 20rem)
- **Shape**: Rounded rectangle (rounded-2xl)
- **Hover Effect**: Slight scale increase (hover:scale-105)
- **Image Handling**: Uses `object-cover` for proper image scaling
- **Fallback**: Shows large emoji if no image URL is provided

### Visual Design

- Clean white card with rounded corners and shadow
- Gradient background on the image container (primary to primary2 colors)
- Responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop
- Smooth hover effects and transitions

### User Experience

- Two action buttons: "Explore Tax Services" and "Maybe Later"
- Clear visual hierarchy with title, description, and call-to-action
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support

## Styling

The banner uses the project's color scheme:

- Primary colors: `primary` (#ED6A06) and `primary2` (#FFAB6B)
- Semi-transparent black overlay: `bg-black bg-opacity-50`
- White content card with subtle shadows
- Gray text for secondary information

## Behavior

1. **Appearance**: Banner appears 1 second after page load
2. **Persistence**: If user closes the banner, it won't show again (stored in localStorage)
3. **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-first design
4. **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Interactions**: Multiple ways to interact (image click, action buttons, close button)

## Integration

The banner is already integrated into the main App.js file and will appear on all pages. It's positioned with a high z-index (50) to ensure it appears above other content.

## Image Requirements

When using the `imageUrl` prop:

- **Size**: Recommended minimum 400x400px for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square images work best, but any ratio will be cropped to fit
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Path**: Use relative paths from the public folder (e.g., `/images/tax.jpg`)
